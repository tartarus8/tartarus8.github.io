# Hello!

This is your tiny website on GitHub Pages. Start by editing **_config.yml** (site title, URL) and the links in **_data/nav.yml**.

- The code is intentionally small and modular (layout + includes + data).
- Add new pages by creating a `.md` file with `layout: default` in the front matter.

ðŸ‘‰ Head over to the [About](/about/) page to see the simple profile layout.
